Hello, I'm making my notes available in makdown format.
Feel free to correct any of my errors and add some stuff.
I put some translations in English in consideration of our non Portuguese speaking colleagues.
I recommend using typora to edit this.

For now I'm including the PDF, but there's always a change I forget to compile it. I will probably remove it in the future since GIT is not really good handling PDFs. So it's best to get a way to compile it yourself, again I recommend to use typora, although it can't be used in terminal :(  it's the one that has gotten me the best results. If know a good one let me know. I've tried **pandoc** and **markdown-pdf** they work, but didn't got as good a result as typora.
